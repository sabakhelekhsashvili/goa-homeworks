1. What are High-Level Programming Languages?

High-level programming languages are designed to be easier for humans to understand and write. They are closer to natural language (like English) than to machine language (binary or assembly code). They allow developers to write code without worrying much about the underlying hardware, such as memory management or processor instructions. The key characteristics of high-level programming languages are:

Abstraction from hardware: They do not require the programmer to manage memory or interact with the hardware directly. Instead, the language runtime (such as a virtual machine or interpreter) handles such concerns.
Portability: Code written in high-level languages can typically run on different types of computer systems with minimal modification, thanks to compilers or interpreters that adapt the code for different hardware architectures.
Ease of use: High-level languages often include features like error checking, built-in libraries, and simple syntax, making them easier for developers to use and reducing the potential for bugs.
